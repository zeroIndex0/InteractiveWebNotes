# InteractiveWebNotes

The website link is in the description above, go ahead and take a look.

I thought I might as well try out Github Pages by posting the notes I have been taking recently.

Keep in mind, these are notes and I wasn't going for any kind of style or beauty.  These were personal notes that I decided to publish.

If you stumble across this and have little knowledge on the subject, I hope that these notes could help you understand some interactions between JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  I would be happy to answer any questions you might have. You can find my contact eamil in my profile.

It also seems that I have to have my html page titled "index.html" From doing some research, it seems that the html file needs to be the first file to load and when I had its original name (domManipulation.html), it didn't want to load.  Something that is worth remembering and knowing about.
