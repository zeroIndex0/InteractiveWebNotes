# InteractiveWebNotes

The website link is in the description above, go ahead and take a look.

I thought I might as well try using Github Pages to post the notes I have been taking in web form.

Keep in mind, these are note and I wasn't going for anything at all like beauty.  These were personal notes that I decided to publish.  That way I can also let you know that I've been taking notes.  I didn't know about Github Pages, or I would have been publishing my notes as I worked on them.

If you stumble across this and have little knowledge on the subject, I hope that these notes could help you understand some interactions between JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  I would be happy to answer any questions you might have. You can find my contact eamil in my profile.

It also seems that I have to have my html page titled "index.html" It needs to be the first thing to load and when I had its original name, it didn't want to load.  Something that is worth remembering for Github Pages
