Notes I have been taking on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

I thought I might as well try using Github Pages to post the notes I have been taking in web form.

Keep in mind, these are note and I wasn't going for anything at all like beauty.  These were personal notes that I decided to publish.  That way I can also let you know that I've been taking notes.  I didn't know about Github Pages, or I would have been publishing my notes as I worked on them.

If you stumble across this and have little knowledge on the subject, I hope that these notes could help you understand some interactions between JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  I would be happy to answer any questions you might have. You can find my contact eamil in my profile.
